Pong is a simple yet engaging arcade game where two players control paddles on either side of the screen and compete to bounce a ball back and forth.

- **Player 2 (Right Paddle):** Use the 'Arrow Up' key to move the paddle up and the 'Arrow Down' key to move it down.
- Try to bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points.
- The game continues until one player reaches a predefined score or until you decide to stop playing.
